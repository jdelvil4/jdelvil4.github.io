## Selected Dataset: NYC Taxis: A Day in the Life
This dataset visualizes the travel paths of individual NYC taxis. It can be applied in many contexts, including transportation planning and business strategy. For example, the New York City Transit Authority could use it to identify underserved regions, while companies such as Uber and Lyft could analyze it to find local market gaps and areas with heavy taxi competition.

## Selected Book: Neural Networks and Deep Learning
This book explores the fascinating world of neural networks, modeled after how the human brain processes information. I found this particular book interesting as I have a background in both psychology and computer science, and neural networks merge the two. Neural networks are also poised to expand far beyond just STEM-adjacent fields, being integrated into many other sectors in the coming years.
